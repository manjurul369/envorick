      description: "Team EnvoRick visited a district-level plastic waste collection and shredding facility in Barishal. These factories collect plastic waste from across the district and process them by shredding into smaller pieces. We collected samples of HDPE and PET plastics from their facility to analyze their potential in concrete brick production. During our visit, we observed the shredding process and how plastics are handled.Spoke with workers and factory owners to understand their business model. Explored what happens to the shredded plastics ‚Äî from storage in tons to resale or export. Learned how plastics are segregated, cleaned, and stored. This visit provided crucial insights into the local plastic supply hain, helping us assess the viability of integrating recycled plastic waste into sustainable construction materials.",
